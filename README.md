# ocr_transcription
A Jupyter Notebook for some document transcription work


1. Download Anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
    (or somehow get Jupyter Notebook to work)
2. Download this JupyterNotebook
3. Obtain a Google Cloud account and (for this low-security way) insert the security code into the code. (Ctrl-F for "KEY".)
4. Run the code for a given folder, for a given filetype (.png, .jpg, etc.) 
      This works for certain file types, not others. For example, this method will not work for pdfs. For those a hacker's shortcut is to take screenshots of the pdfs and save them as .pngs in a directory, and then run this code for that directory.
